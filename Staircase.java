In this question, you need to write a program that prints a staircase of size N.

This is a staircase of size n=4:

   #
  ##
 ###
####
Its base and height are both equal to n. It is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

Input Format
A single integer, n, denotes the size of the staircase.

Output Format
Print a staircase of size n using # symbols and spaces.

Note: The last line must not have spaces in it.

Example 1
Input

6
Output

     #
    ##
   ###
  ####

######
Explanation

The staircase is right-aligned, composed of # symbols and spaces, and has a height and width of n=6.

You might notice, first line has 5 spaces (n-1) followed by 1 # and the last line has 0 spaces (n-n) and 6 # (n)

Example 2
Input

5
Output

    #
